<!-- Add style rules for the img tag to make it responsive to the size of its container. It should display as a block-level element, it should fit the full width of its container without stretching, and it should keep its original aspect ratio.

Your img tag should have a max-width set to 100%.
Your img tag should have a display set to block.
Your img tag should have a height set to auto. -->
